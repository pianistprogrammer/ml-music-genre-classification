# ml-music-genre-classification
Three Machine Learning method have been put to test; The Multi-layer Perceptron, CNN and RNN using LSTM.

https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification

Once extracted, the folder generated is labelled Data with other folders inside. the file `mfcc_data_extraction.py`

The extraction process eventually generates a `data.json` file which contains all the mfcc you need for the classification

Best of Luck !!
